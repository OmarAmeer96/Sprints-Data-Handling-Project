## Features

### User Management

- **Add User**: Add new user profiles by providing details such as name, username, email, address, phone, website, and company information.
- **Update User**: Update existing user profiles with new information.
- **Delete User**: Delete user profiles with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions.

### Data Handling

- **Fetch User Data**: Fetch user data from an external API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`) and store it locally using `shared_preferences`.
- **Cache User Data**: Cache user data locally to improve performance and enable offline access.

### UI Components

- **User Details**: Show detailed information about a selected user, including their name, email, address, phone, website, and company.
- **Team Members**: Display a list of team members with their names. A confetti animation is triggered when a team member's name is tapped.

### Styling and Theming

- **Custom Themes**: Use platform-specific themes (Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows) to ensure a consistent look and feel across devices.
- **Launch Screen**: Custom launch screens for Android and iOS.

### Animations and Effects

- **Confetti Animation**: A fun confetti animation is displayed when interacting with team members.

### Form Validation

- **Input Fields**: Input fields for user details include validation to ensure data integrity.

### State Management
